## âš¡  Main Repo

[WhiteLightning](https://github.com/Inoxoft/whitelightning) distills massive, state-of-the-art language models into lightweight, hyper-efficient text classifiers. It's a command-line tool that lets you create specialized models that run anywhereâ€”from the cloud to the edgeâ€”using the universal ONNX format for maximum compatibility.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

Want to test your ONNX models across multiple programming languages? Check out our [WhiteLightning Test Framework](https://github.com/Inoxoft/whitelightning) - a comprehensive cross-language testing suite that validates your models in:

* **8 Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, C, Node.js, Rust, Dart, and Swift
* **Performance Benchmarking**: Detailed timing, memory usage, and throughput analysis
* **Automated Testing**: GitHub Actions workflows for continuous validation
* **Real-world Scenarios**: Test with custom inputs and edge cases

Perfect for ensuring your WhiteLightning models work consistently across all target platforms and deployment environments.
